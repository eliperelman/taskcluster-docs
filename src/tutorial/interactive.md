The goal of this interactive tutorial is to show you how to access TaskCluster
APIs with modern asynchronous Javascript patterns. This page will give a brief
introduction to modern asynchronous Javascript patterns, and the rest of the
tutorials are focused on how to use TaskCluster.

The first tutorial [Authentication](authenticate) **must** be completed before
you proceed to the other tutorials, or the examples will not work. The first
few tutorials aim to give you a quick introduction and it's recommended that
you complete them.  However, before you get started you should have a basic
understanding of ES2015+ features like Promises and async functions. "[Modern
Asynchronous JavaScript](async-javascript)" discusses the background if you don't
have it already. There are also other articles and sites dedicated to these
language features.

To keep all of this exciting, the tutorials are designed to run in your browser.
The skills you learn here can be employed on both servers and static web-sites
using TaskCluster APIs to display state, listen for events, spawn tasks and many
other things.

Note: the graphical TaskCluster tools on `tools.taskcluster.net` are all
written in client-side JavaScript. In fact, the entire site is a static
website hosted on a CDN.
