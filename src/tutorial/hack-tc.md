Hacking on TaskCluster is really easy. Head over to the [TaskCluster GitHub
page](https://github.com/taskcluster) and dive right in. Fork a project you
want to contribute to and feel free to make pull requests.

The code base uses ES2015+ syntax and features like Promises and Async Functions.
Jump over to [async JavaScript](async-javascript) if you need to learn more.
