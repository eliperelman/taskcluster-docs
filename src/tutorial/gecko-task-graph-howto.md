title: Changing the Task Graph
---

We know that task-graph configuration is not an area of expertise for most Firefox developers.
So the task-graph generation machinery is designed to make common changes easy.

Please see the [Gecko Documentation » TaskCluster Task-Graph Generation » How Tos](http://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/taskcluster/taskcluster/how-tos.html) for some general help on modifying the task graph and, more importantly, recipes for some of the more common modifications.

The TaskCluster team also stands ready to help, if you need additional assistance.
